# ChessV-expansion
This is a fork of ChessV 2.2 by Greg Strong.
It adds support for boards up to 16x16 and a way to implement pieces which change direction during their moves.
Using this three variants are added: Chess on Really Big Board and Golden Age Chess on Really Big Board by Ralph Betza and DemiChess With Different Armies, a variant proposed by Betza and completed by me.
